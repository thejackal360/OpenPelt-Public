OpenPelt is a faster-than-real-time temperature control simulation library.
OpenPelt contains utilities for developing and verifying temperature control
algorithms as well as a model of a thermoelectric cooler to act as the plant.
OpenPelt also enables exporting simulation results to [Fenics](https://fenicsproject.org/)
to simulate the control system's impact on a three-dimensional heat diffusion 
model.
