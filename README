Neural controller class uses the MLP class (Pytorch class). The neural
controller class provides a method called ** learn ** which allows for learning
the weights of an MLP via Backpropagation. THe learning process uses the
Adam optimizer and the MSE as loss function. The MLP is a one hidden layer
feed-forward neural network. The number of hidden units is a parameter of the
model as well as the bias and the learning rate.
